This is my PM566 final project website: https://vivi0903.github.io/PM566-Final/, my project title is Analysis of crime incidence and distribution in Los Angeles.

- The primary question is whether the number of crimes has decreased in LA from 2020 to 2021.

- The sub-question: 

  Which area of Los Angeles has the highest number of crimes in 2021?
  
  What is the most common crime type in 2021 and which area occurred most?
